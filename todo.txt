OI! WHAT'RE YEW DOIN' IN MY SWAMP?
GET OU', I'M MODDING HERE.
- Many HUD elements can now be individually toggled on/off, allowing you to use select elements from KHUD or other HUD mods as you please
	* Panels that can be moved:
		- Player Health
		- Player weapons/ammo
		- Player compass
		(Movable buffs panel will come soon)
		- Teammate Health
		- Chat
- buff panel is now set enabled independently of whether or not your player/team panels are enabled or disabled; this means you can effectively use KineticHUD as a buff tracker standalone
- Added an option for "real ammo" count
- added a voice chat indicator
- added a compass (disabled by default) - enable it in options!
- added the ability to use nav_surfaces for the cartographer- useful for custom heists, and also vanilla panic room in particular and no other vanilla heist because thanks overkill
- fixed incorrect location names on Branch Bank (west/east alley directions swapped)
- fixed localizing nav_surface location names for teammates 
- fixed teammate locations not always being detected correctly with the cartographer for non-english platforms
- fixed teammate locations displaying as "location_unknown" for unknown nav_surface names while having nav_surface names enabled - intended behaviour is to only update/change the nav_surface name if the name is not "location_unknown"
- changed down counter icon from heart to smaller diamond

- fixed crashing after changing hud options while not in-game
- rewrote a bunch of stuff to make that stuff possible
- trimmed bad code

Priority TODO:
- set downs at game start
- update mod options menu

- separate quickchat panel from chat
- allow custom x/y for quickchat panel

- disable vanilla state icons for teammates
- align teammate eq to right instead of left
- location unknown
- downcounter only/not shown for late join teammates?


- assaults don't sync time
- assault states sync every second

- downcounter: option to show downs instead of revives
- custom interaction circle w/ timer?
- show teammates' interaction circles

- priority buffs in center
- create ammo counter display for teammates

- fix objective panel number (eg "4/6 bags") not displaying until the last one and immediately disappearing

- enable changing hud elements (update armor/hp values) for other players
- test + apply new hud (equipment, grenades) changes for teammates
- custom adjust for:
		- Buffs panel
			* Adjust number of buffs per column	
		- Mission Equipment
		- Teammate panels
			* move entire parent _khud_player panel
			* equipment
			* grenades
			* weapon
		- Location panel
		- Mission timer
		- Objectives HUD
		- Compass panel: custom width
- mission panel hides/shows hostages
- re-add condition icon
- fix vanilla deployable icon showing up as blank (possible override in effect)
- fix firemode icons not scaling

- add hp bar width scale setting
- deployables waypoints
- disable hud elements (eg. buffs only)

- Fix ai masks
- Sixth sense does not work as a buff (temp disabled)


- crosshair color multiplechoice (normal, enemy, civ, bot ai)

- Animate teammate special eq sort/apply to local
- Organize player/teammate hud
	* recreate carry panel with player bag icon
	* add (diamond_bg_w = margin + diamond:w())
	* restyle carry panel
	* Resize/realign teammate HP/ARM numbers
- integrate custom x/y hud element positioning 
- mission hud
	* menu option for mission hud
	* fancy frivolous init anims (checkbox, banner, container)
	* fadein objective amount text
	* anim for changing objective text
	* reminder box resize anim
	* obj toast

- add 3 new maps per update (ongoing)

- Add buff priority: table.sort buffs on add
- More prominent High Priority Buffs (make swansong/bulletstorm more obvious)
- Pocket ecm timer from other clients
- QuickChat
	* Manually block input for quickchat
	* Use TF2 system (z,x,c; 1-9) instead of Rocket League (1-4,1,4)
- Write improved waypoints 
- Voice chat indicator

FEATURES:
- dynamic bloom for crosshair

- Stats Screen

- Ammo counter for underbarrel
- Sentry tracking

- Sync Assault state from hosts with KHUD
- Converts panel
- Enemy health bars
- Menu: Toggle vs hold to use quickchat menu?
- Show kills rem. free to grenade from team ai boost
- Menu: Hide crosshair on hit with enhanced hitmarkers

PLANNED, POSSIBLY:
- Flashbang status for teammates who are estimated to be flashbanged/synced flashbanged state + duration to other hud users
- Enemy Counter?
- Show berserker "effective" maxhp bar

TODO: 
- Animate dark souls-style "lost hp" drain
- HoldTheKey add hook on key bound

BUG FIXES:
- Assault phases don't always show timer
- does not show shaped charges (deployable amount[2]) on start; fixed after swap
- incorrect sentry amount shown when replenish (not updated)
- status icons still display (override set_condition) (temporarily overridden)
- ex pres z fighting with health bar gradient

POLISH:
- separate region from teammate panel (should integrate with stats panel) (requires photoshop mockup)
- bag carry should be on the outside since it pops up, and should be more visible
- ex pres should be more visible in case of bars with similar colors (test fix)

- colorblind friendly
- beautify downs
- standardise color tweakdata
- standardise panel_border naming
- stats panel shows weapon kills with weapon's custom name (weapon.custom_name)
- fadeout alpha for used equipments
- beautify weapon kills
