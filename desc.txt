KineticHUD Rising: Revengeance

KineticHUD 2, also known as *"KineticHUD II: Die Harder: River of Fear: Nutty By Nature: Deja Vu: Son Of KineticHUD: Beyond Cyberspace: KineticHUD vs The Cyber Insects: KineticHUD's New Groove: Hawaiian Style: The Third"*, alternately called simply *"KineticHUD*", and abbreviated to KHUD, is a new-old HUD mod for PAYDAY 2. It is based on KineticHUD, but sufficiently different such that I opted to define it as a new mod, with a new mod page. 
You can think of this as the full version of KineticHUD (that was one long beta, amirite?), with more polish, customization, and overall more feature-completeness.

### About KHUD:

[spoiler]
	vr compatibility:
		yes (may not look the best, but it's stable)
		please report compatibility issues with VR to me
	hud customizability:
		each element should have a changeable scale
		each element should have a changeable position
		hud movable by mouse dragging?
	Linux compatibility:
		The Linux version(s) of sBLT are known to have issues with loading custom fonts and textures. As this mod is heavily dependent on several included custom fonts with KineticHUD, Linux compatibility is not tested or confirmed.
	compatibility/modularity:
		do not break other mods if at all possible
		do not be broken by other mods if at all possible
		option to disable the hooks or functions in commonly used functions, if hooked, to allow for increased compatibility and also customization
		state flags for whether a given hud component is loaded should be checked when using hud setter functions, to allow for modularity/customization in enabling/disabling hud elements
	information:
		add information. you can move it, but don't remove it.
	accessibility:
		colorblind options:
			changeable colors for any given hud color

## Installation:
Unzip the mod called "KineticHUD" into the "mods" folder.

## Recommended companion mods and compatibility:
KineticHUD was written with specific compatibility code for a few mods. I personally recommend that you try some of these out, to your taste:
- Better Assault Indicators, by Dom
- Compass HUD Standalone, by me
- Down Counter Standalone, by me
- GameInfoManager, by pjal3urb https://bitbucket.org/pjal3urb/gameinfomanager - this is what powers the buff indicator in KineticHUD.

Attempt to use with other main HUD mods (VanillaHUD Plus, WolfHUD, PocoHUD, etc) at your own risk
