KineticHUD Rising: Revengeance

KineticHUD 2, also known as *"KineticHUD II: Die Harder: River of Fear: Nutty By Nature: Deja Vu: Son Of KineticHUD: Beyond Cyberspace: KineticHUD vs The Cyber Insects: KineticHUD's New Groove: Hawaiian Style: The Third"*, alternately called simply *"KineticHUD*", and abbreviated to KHUD, is a new-old HUD mod for PAYDAY 2. It is based on KineticHUD, but sufficiently different such that I opted to define it as a new mod, with a new mod page. 
You can think of this as the full version of KineticHUD (that was one long beta, amirite?), with more polish, customization, and overall more feature-completeness.
